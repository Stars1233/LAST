The code provided for review consists of multiple files with various functions related to analyzing and scanning code for security and health issues using OpenAI and Google Gemini APIs. Here are some potential security vulnerabilities and issues that should be addressed:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**:
    - There might be a risk of exposing API keys if they are hardcoded or improperly managed. Ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` are securely managed and not hardcoded in the source code. Use environment variables or a secure vault.

2. **Command Injection**:
    - Functions like `get_changed_files`, `get_line_changes`, and `get_changed_files_github` use `subprocess.check_output` to execute Git commands. Ensure that any inputs to these commands are properly sanitized to prevent command injection attacks.

3. **File Handling**:
    - When reading files (especially in `analyze_code_context` and `gather_full_code` functions), ensure that the file paths are validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    - Use context managers (`with` statements) for file operations to ensure files are properly closed after operations.

4. **Error Handling**:
    - There are several places where exceptions are caught broadly using `except Exception as e`. This can mask other issues and make debugging difficult. Consider catching specific exceptions and handling them appropriately.
    - In functions like `get_line_changes`, ensure that all potential exceptions are logged or handled to prevent silent failures.

5. **Injection Risks in AI Models**:
    - When sending data to AI models (e.g., in `full_sec_scan`, `partial_sec_scan`), ensure that the data is properly sanitized and does not include sensitive information. AI models can inadvertently leak information if prompts are not correctly managed.

6. **Logging Sensitive Information**:
    - Avoid logging sensitive information such as file contents or API responses unless absolutely necessary. Ensure that logs are properly secured and access-controlled.

7. **Concurrency Issues**:
    - Functions that use `asyncio` should be properly managed to prevent concurrency issues. Ensure that any shared resources are protected against race conditions.

8. **Use of External Libraries**:
    - Ensure that all external libraries and dependencies are up to date with the latest security patches. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`.

9. **Security Headers and Best Practices**:
    - When making HTTP requests (e.g., using `requests.get`), consider using security headers like `User-Agent` and ensure SSL/TLS verification is enforced.

10. **Data Exposure**:
    - Be cautious about exposing detailed application data in AI prompts or external requests. Use redaction or summarization where possible to minimize information leakage.

By addressing the above issues, you can enhance the security posture of the application. Additionally, consider conducting regular security reviews and penetration testing to identify further vulnerabilities.
